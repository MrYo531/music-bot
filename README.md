# Discord Music Bot

A simple discord music bot that can play songs from YouTube or SoundCloud through the voice channel.

## Features

Currently the bot can only play music through YT links.

Here is a list of what still needs to be implemented and improved:

* Play music through SC links
* Let the user search for music (YT and SC)
* Download music faster or find a way to stream it (this has been difficult to figure out)

## Commands

/play

/disconnect

/pause

/resume

/stop

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.10.2
* discord.py[voice]
* yt_dlp

All of the dependendent libraries are already included in the python environment, 'bot-env'. That way nothing additional is required to be downloaded or installed. 

### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
